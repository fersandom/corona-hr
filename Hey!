Thanks for taking the time to take a look

I am sorry after so long only this but I have had a weird couple weeks.

I understand I have used way more arrays than I need. That is for sure.

But I would love if you could tell me if there is a better way to call the render functions. I would like to do it outside of the fetch function.

Thanks again! And remember, you say the time and place for that beer.
